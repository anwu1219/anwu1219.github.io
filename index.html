Welcome! I am a second-year Computer Science PhD student at Stanford University advised by Clark Barrett. I am interested in formal verification and machine learning. I work on a formal analyzer of deep neural network called <a href="https://github.com/guykatzz/Marabou">Marabou</a>. I did my undergraduate at <a href "https://www.davidson.edu/">Davidson College</a>, where I majored in Mathematics and Philosophy.
