Welcome to my home page! I am a second year Computer Science PhD student at Stanford University. I am interested in formal verification and machine learning. I work on a formal analyzer of deep neural network called Marabou. I did my undergraduate at Davidson College, where I studied Philosophy, Mathematics, and Computer Science.
